🌐 About This Website

This is my personal portfolio website, built to showcase who I am, the projects I’ve created, and my coding abilities.
It serves as a central hub where visitors can:

    Explore my professional and personal projects.

    Learn about my skills, experience, and background.

    See real examples of my work and technical capabilities in action.

The site is fully custom-built, reflecting my style, attention to detail, and technical craftsmanship. Every section — from layout to animations — was designed to communicate both creativity and clean coding practices.
